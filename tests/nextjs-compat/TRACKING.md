**Result: 6/8 pass, 1 skip (vinext issue), 1 skip (N/A)**

### Findings

- **React `use()` hook warning**: All pages using `use(getData())` emit "Invalid hook call" warnings in stderr. The data renders correctly, but there's likely a duplicate React instance in the RSC environment. Not blocking but should be investigated.
- **RSC module caching**: The ISR timestamp test reveals that `Date.now()` inside an async function called via `use()` returns the same value across requests. The RSC module's function is not re-executed per request — the promise is cached at module scope. This affects any pattern that expects fresh data on each server render.

**Result: 3/6 pass (HTTP-level), 3 skip (vinext issues), 5 N/A (browser-only, dev overlay)**

### Findings

- **Server component errors return 500**: When a server component throws during RSC rendering, vinext returns HTTP 500 instead of catching the error and rendering the nearest error.tsx boundary with a 200. The RSC stream correctly encodes the error, but the SSR layer doesn't handle error chunks by activating React error boundaries.
- **generateMetadata() errors bypass error.tsx**: When `generateMetadata()` throws, vinext's metadata resolution lets the error propagate to the top-level handler, triggering Vite's dev error overlay instead of rendering the co-located error.tsx boundary.
- **Server stays up**: Despite errors, the dev server doesn't crash — all error paths return some HTTP response.

**Result: 8/8 pass (HTTP-level), 0 skip, 9 N/A (browser-only, build-only, Pages Router)**

### Findings

- **next/dynamic works well in App Router SSR**: All four dynamic import patterns (React.lazy, server dynamic, client dynamic, server-importing-client) render correctly in SSR HTML.
- **ssr: false correctly excluded**: Content from `dynamic(() => import(...), { ssr: false })` is properly excluded from SSR HTML, matching Next.js behavior.
- **Named exports via .then()**: The pattern `dynamic(() => import('./mod').then(m => ({ default: m.NamedExport })))` works correctly.
- **No issues found**: This is the first chunk with 100% pass rate on all HTTP-testable assertions.

**Result: 23/23 pass, 0 skip, 14 N/A (build-only, streaming, edge, console inspection)**

### Findings

- **Route handlers work comprehensively**: All HTTP methods, body parsing, headers, cookies, dynamic params, and error handling work correctly.
- **NextResponse helpers work**: `redirect()`, `json()` all produce correct responses.
- **Auto-implementations work**: HEAD and OPTIONS are correctly auto-implemented when not explicitly exported.
- **No issues found**: Second chunk with 100% pass rate on all testable assertions.

**Result: 30/30 pass, 0 skip, 15 N/A (browser-only, file-based images, HMR)**

### Findings

- **Metadata rendering is comprehensive**: All tested metadata properties (title, description, OG, Twitter, robots, alternates, generateMetadata) render correctly in SSR HTML.
- **Minor formatting differences**:
  - Keywords joined with `", "` (space after comma) vs Next.js `","` — both valid HTML
  - React JSX renders `hrefLang` (camelCase) in HTML output instead of `hreflang` — browsers handle both
- **Title template works correctly**: Layout `{ template: "%s | Layout" }` is properly applied to child page titles.
- **generateMetadata() works with dynamic params**: Async metadata function receives and resolves params correctly.

**Result: 5/5 pass, 0 skip, 25+ N/A (browser-only)**

### Findings

- **Server-side redirect() and notFound() work correctly**: Both produce correct HTTP status codes and headers.
- **noindex meta tag injected for 404 pages**: Both explicit notFound() and non-existent routes include `<meta name="robots" content="noindex"/>`.
- **Navigation tests are overwhelmingly browser-based**: >80% of the Next.js navigation test suite requires Playwright for client-side interactions. The HTTP-level tests here provide a baseline confirming server-side navigation primitives work.

## Chunks 8-10: Assessment

### Chunk 8: parallel-routes-and-interception

**Source**: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/test/e2e/app-dir/parallel-routes-and-interception/parallel-routes-and-interception.test.ts

**Not ported — already covered by existing vinext tests.**

The Next.js test is ~25 cases, almost entirely browser-based (client-side nav, back/forward, URL bar, prefetch, loading states). The ~3 SSR-testable patterns (nested parallel slot matching, route group + parallel slots, 404 on direct slot access) are already covered by `tests/app-router.test.ts` (lines 141-288) with 13 existing tests for parallel routes and intercepting routes using pre-existing fixtures in `fixtures/app-basic/app/dashboard/@team/`, `@analytics/`, and `feed/@modal/`.

### Chunk 9: app (main kitchen sink)

**Source**: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/test/e2e/app-dir/app/index.test.ts

**Not ported — ~90% overlap with existing vinext tests.**

The Next.js test is a massive kitchen-sink with 50+ cases. The SSR-testable patterns (dynamic routes, catch-all, layouts, client component SSR, loading.tsx, search params, 404, metadata, RSC content-type) are already thoroughly covered by `tests/app-router.test.ts` and `tests/nextjs-compat/*.test.ts` chunks 1-7. The remaining tests are browser-only (Link, HMR, client-side nav, rewrites, middleware).

### Chunk 10: app-static

**Source**: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/test/e2e/app-dir/app-static/app-static.test.ts

**Not ported — build-time/ISR-specific.**

The Next.js test is ~40+ cases focused on production build artifacts, ISR cache behavior, `revalidateTag`/`revalidatePath`, fetch caching configs, and prerender manifests. None of these apply to dev SSR testing. The few dev-testable patterns (`dynamicParams`, `generateStaticParams`, `force-dynamic/force-static`) are already covered by `tests/app-router.test.ts` (lines 711-850).

## Playwright Browser Tests

Three Playwright spec files cover client-side behaviors that cannot be tested via HTTP-level Vitest:

**Config**: `tests/e2e/app-router/nextjs-compat/playwright.nextjs-compat.config.ts`
**Run**: `node node_modules/@playwright/test/cli.js test -c tests/e2e/app-router/nextjs-compat/playwright.nextjs-compat.config.ts`
**Prereq**: Build vinext (`npx tsc -p packages/vinext/tsconfig.json`) and start dev server (`npx vite --port 4174` from `fixtures/app-basic`)

### Chunk 4: dynamic (Playwright)

**Local**: `tests/e2e/app-router/nextjs-compat/dynamic.spec.ts`

| 2   | dynamic() components remain visible after hydration       | PASS   | All 4 dynamic import patterns still present post-hydration                |
| 3   | named export via dynamic() renders button after hydration | PASS   | `#client-button` interactive in browser                                   |
| 4   | ssr:false page shows dynamic content after hydration      | PASS   | Static text immediate, dynamic appears after hydration                    |

**Result: 4/4 pass, 0 skip**

### Chunk 6: metadata (Playwright)

**Local**: `tests/e2e/app-router/nextjs-compat/metadata.spec.ts`

| #   | Test                                                     | Status | Notes                                               |

| 2   | description meta tag is present in DOM                   | PASS   | `meta[name="description"]` queried in browser       |
| 3   | title template applies correctly                         | PASS   | `"Page                                              | Layout"` in document.title |
| 4   | title template applies to child page                     | PASS   | `"Extra Page                                        | Layout"`                   |
| 5   | OpenGraph meta tags present in DOM                       | PASS   | og:title, og:description, og:type verified          |
| 6   | Twitter card meta tags present in DOM                    | PASS   | twitter:card, twitter:title verified                |
| 7   | generateMetadata renders correct title for dynamic route | PASS   | `"params - my-slug"`                                |
| 8   | title updates on client-side navigation                  | PASS   | Link click -> document.title updates without reload |

**Result: 8/8 pass, 0 skip**

### Chunk 7: navigation (Playwright)

**Local**: `tests/e2e/app-router/nextjs-compat/navigation.spec.ts`

| #   | Test                                                       | Status   | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 4   | client-side notFound() trigger renders not-found component | **SKIP** | Client-side `notFound()` from "use client" component crashes React tree instead of rendering not-found boundary. Body shows raw Vite RSC entry text. Fix: `packages/vinext/src/shims/navigation.ts` — need client-side NotFoundBoundary that catches NEXT_NOT_FOUND error. |
| 5   | Link navigates client-side without full reload             | PASS     | Window marker preserved across navigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Combined Key Metrics

- **400 tests passing** (362 Vitest + 38 Playwright) across 35 test files
- **11 tests skipped** (6 Vitest + 5 Playwright) with detailed root-cause analysis and fix locations
- **0 failures** — all non-skipped tests pass
- **188+ N/A** — build-only, or already covered by existing tests
- **2 new issues found** in Phase 3: duplicate title with Suspense layout, external redirect in server actions

### Issues Found (Fix Backlog)

1. **RSC module caching across requests** — `Date.now()` cached in dev. Fix: `packages/vinext/src/entries/app-rsc-entry.ts`
2. ~~**Server component errors return 500 instead of rendering error.tsx**~~ — **FIXED**. Added `renderErrorBoundaryPage()` in `entries/app-rsc-entry.ts` that renders the nearest error.tsx wrapped in layouts when a server component throws. Catches errors in `buildPageElement` catch (metadata errors) and SSR catch (render errors). Returns 200 with error boundary HTML.
3. ~~**generateMetadata() errors bypass error.tsx**~~ — **FIXED**. Same fix as #2 — the `buildPageElement` catch now calls `renderErrorBoundaryPage()` for non-special errors from `generateMetadata()`.
4. ~~**React `use()` hook warning**~~ — **FIXED**. Not duplicate React — the pre-render check (`entries/app-rsc-entry.ts:1268`) calls `PageComponent()` directly outside React's render cycle, triggering "Invalid hook call" for components using `use()`. Fix: suppress the expected warning during the pre-render test.
5. ~~**Keywords separator formatting**~~ — **FIXED**. Changed `metadata.keywords.join(", ")` to `.join(",")` in `metadata.tsx:338` to match Next.js behavior.
6. ~~**Client-side notFound() crashes React tree**~~ — **FIXED**. Added `NotFoundBoundary` class component to `error-boundary.tsx` that catches `NEXT_NOT_FOUND`/`NEXT_HTTP_ERROR_FALLBACK;404` errors. Wrapped in `buildPageElement()` above `ErrorBoundary`, with pre-rendered not-found.tsx element as fallback. Playwright test now passes.
7. ~~**useParams() returns empty on client after hydration**~~ — **FIXED**. Root cause: `setClientParams()` was never called in the browser. Fix: server now sends `X-Vinext-Params` header in RSC responses (`entries/app-rsc-entry.ts:1295`), browser entry reads it during hydration and client-side navigation (`entries/app-rsc-entry.ts:1594-1597, 1612-1617`). All 3 Playwright useParams tests now pass.
8. ~~**Client-side error.tsx boundary doesn't activate during navigation**~~ — **FIXED**. Added `onCaughtError: function() {}` to `hydrateRoot()` call in `generateBrowserEntry()` to suppress Vite dev overlay for errors caught by React error boundaries. Combined with PR #51's `renderErrorBoundaryPage()` for SSR-side error rendering.

## Phase 2: Additional Test Chunks (COMPLETE)

Gap analysis against the full Next.js e2e/app-dir suite (365 test dirs) identified these
high-value areas where vinext **implements the feature** but had thin or no Next.js-compat
test coverage. Ordered by impact on real-world app confidence.

### Chunk 11: hooks — `useRouter`, `usePathname`, `useSearchParams`, `useParams` ✅

**Next.js sources**: `hooks`, `use-params`, `use-selected-layout-segment-s`, `params-hooks-compat`
**Local**: `tests/nextjs-compat/hooks.test.ts`, `tests/e2e/app-router/nextjs-compat/hooks.spec.ts`
**Result**: Vitest 7/7 pass | Playwright 8/8 pass

Vitest SSR tests all pass — useParams correctly renders in HTML for single, nested, and
catch-all routes. useSearchParams and usePathname work. useRouter page renders.

Playwright: All hooks work in the browser. useParams returns correct values after hydration
for single, nested, and catch-all dynamic routes. useSearchParams reactive updates work.
useRouter.push/replace/back all work.

### Chunk 12: forbidden / unauthorized — SKIPPED (already well-covered)

Existing vinext tests already thoroughly cover forbidden/unauthorized: unit tests for
throw/digest, SSR integration tests for 403/401 rendering with custom boundaries, and
Playwright E2E status code checks. No additional Next.js-compat tests needed.

### Chunk 13: rsc-basic — Server/client component fundamentals ✅

**Next.js sources**: `rsc-basic`, `rsc-query-routing`, `rsc-redirect`
**Local**: `tests/nextjs-compat/rsc-basic.test.ts`, `tests/e2e/app-router/nextjs-compat/rsc-basic.spec.ts`
**Result**: Vitest 8/8 pass | Playwright 5/5 pass

All RSC fundamentals work: server component SSR, props passing to client components,
client component initial state in SSR, null page rendering, async server components,
RSC response content-type (`text/x-component`), 404 for missing routes. In the browser:
client components hydrate and are interactive (counter increments), state persists.

### Chunk 14: error-boundary-navigation — Error recovery during client nav ✅

**Next.js sources**: `error-boundary-navigation`, `errors`
**Local**: `tests/e2e/app-router/nextjs-compat/error-nav.spec.ts`
**Result**: Playwright 4/4 pass, 0 skip

All error boundary navigation tests pass: navigate to error page shows error.tsx boundary,
reset button re-renders error boundary, navigate away from error page works, navigate to
error page and back works. **Previously 3 skipped** — fixed by combining PR #51
(`renderErrorBoundaryPage` for SSR catch) with `onCaughtError` on `hydrateRoot()` to
suppress Vite dev overlay for React-caught errors.

### Chunk 15: streaming / loading.tsx — Suspense boundaries during SSR ✅

**Next.js sources**: `app-rendering` (streaming subset), `searchparams-reuse-loading`,
`app-prefetch-false-loading`, `root-suspense-dynamic`
**Local**: `tests/nextjs-compat/streaming.test.ts`, `tests/e2e/app-router/nextjs-compat/streaming.spec.ts`
**Result**: Vitest 6/6 pass | Playwright 2/2 pass

Streaming SSR works correctly: pages return 200, Suspense boundaries resolve in the
streamed response, nested boundaries with different delays both resolve, loading.tsx
boundary is present, HTML is valid. In browser: streamed content appears after initial
shell, nested boundaries both resolve.

### Chunk 16: set-cookies — Cookie manipulation in server components and actions ✅

**Next.js sources**: `set-cookies`
**Local**: `tests/nextjs-compat/set-cookies.test.ts`
**Result**: Vitest 6/6 pass

Full cookie lifecycle works: `cookies().set()` produces Set-Cookie header, httpOnly
option respected, multiple Set-Cookie headers for multiple cookies, `cookies().delete()`
produces Max-Age=-1 cookie, `cookies().get()` reads from request, missing cookie
returns null.

### Chunk 17: app-css / tailwind — CSS handling in App Router ✅

**Next.js sources**: `app-css`, `tailwind-css`, `css-order`, `css-modules-scoping`
**Local**: `tests/nextjs-compat/app-css.test.ts`
**Result**: Vitest 4/4 pass

CSS modules work in SSR: class names are scoped (not the raw `.heading` but a hash-
suffixed version), page content renders. Global CSS: class names are preserved as-is
(`global-heading`), page content renders. Vite's CSS pipeline integrates correctly.

### Chunk 18: draft-mode — CMS preview workflows ✅

**Next.js sources**: `draft-mode`, `draft-mode-middleware`
**Local**: `tests/nextjs-compat/draft-mode.test.ts`
**Result**: Vitest 4/4 pass

Full draft mode lifecycle works through HTTP: `draftMode().enable()` sets
`__prerender_bypass` cookie, `draftMode().disable()` clears it, `draftMode().isEnabled`
returns false by default and true when bypass cookie is present in the request.

## Phase 3: Server Actions, Revalidation, Prefetch, and More

Targeted the top 10 gaps from the coverage analysis — features vinext implements
but had no Next.js-compat test coverage for.

### Chunk 19: actions-navigation — Server action after client navigation ✅

**Next.js source**: `actions-navigation`
**Local**: `tests/e2e/app-router/nextjs-compat/actions-nav.spec.ts`
**Result**: Playwright 1/1 pass

Tests that server actions work correctly after navigating to a page via client-side
Link click. The action (with a 500ms delay) executes, returns a result, and the
client renders it. Verifies the server action binding isn't broken by client nav.

### Chunk 20: actions-revalidate + router.refresh() ✅

**Next.js sources**: `actions-revalidate-remount`, `revalidatetag-rsc`
**Local**: `tests/nextjs-compat/revalidate.test.ts`, `tests/e2e/app-router/nextjs-compat/actions-revalidate.spec.ts`
**Result**: Vitest 4/4 pass | Playwright 2/2 pass

Vitest: revalidatePath and revalidateTag via route handler API endpoints both
return `{ revalidated: true }`. Page renders correctly with timestamp and form.
After revalidatePath, page re-renders with fresh data.

Playwright: revalidatePath via server action (form button) updates the page
timestamp. router.refresh() also re-renders the page with a new timestamp.

### Chunk 21: app-prefetch — RSC prefetch and Link navigation ✅

**Next.js source**: `app-prefetch`
**Local**: `tests/nextjs-compat/prefetch.test.ts`, `tests/e2e/app-router/nextjs-compat/prefetch.spec.ts`
**Result**: Vitest 4/4 pass | Playwright 3/3 pass

Vitest: RSC `.rsc` endpoint returns `text/x-component` content. Prefetch pages
render with correct links. Both prefetch=true and prefetch=false target pages
are accessible.

Playwright: Link with `prefetch={false}` still allows navigation. Prefetched
link navigates correctly. Navigation via prefetched link does not cause a full
page reload (window marker preserved).

### Chunk 22: metadata-suspense — Metadata in Suspense-wrapped layout ✅

**Next.js source**: `metadata-suspense`
**Local**: `tests/nextjs-compat/metadata-suspense.test.ts`
**Result**: Vitest 2/3 pass, 1 skip

Metadata renders correctly in `<head>` when the layout wraps children in
`<Suspense>`: title, description, and application-name are all present and correct.

**1 skipped**: Duplicate `<title>` tags. Vinext emits the metadata twice — once in
the shell and again when the Suspense boundary resolves. Fix: metadata should be
hoisted above Suspense boundaries in `entries/app-rsc-entry.ts:buildPageElement()`.

### Chunk 23: revalidate-dynamic — revalidatePath/Tag via route handlers ✅

**Next.js source**: `revalidate-dynamic`
**Local**: `tests/nextjs-compat/revalidate.test.ts` (shared with Chunk 20)
**Result**: Covered by Chunk 20 Vitest tests

Route handlers calling `revalidatePath('/')` and `revalidateTag('test-data')`
both work correctly — return `{ revalidated: true }` with 200 status.

### Chunk 24: external-redirect — Server action redirect to external URL ✅

**Next.js source**: `external-redirect`
**Local**: `tests/e2e/app-router/nextjs-compat/external-redirect.spec.ts`
**Result**: Playwright 0/1 pass, 1 skip

**Skipped**: Vinext handles server action redirects via `x-action-redirect` headers
and `window.history.replaceState` + RSC navigate. For external URLs, this tries to
do a client-side RSC navigation instead of `window.location.href = url`. Fix: in
the browser entry's server action callback, detect external redirects (different
origin) and use `window.location.href` instead.

### Chunk 25: search-params-react-key — Component stability across param changes ✅

**Next.js source**: `search-params-react-key`
**Local**: `tests/e2e/app-router/nextjs-compat/search-params-key.spec.ts`
**Result**: Playwright 2/2 pass

Component state (counter) persists across `router.push('?foo=bar')` and
`router.replace('?foo=baz')` — the component tree is NOT remounted when search
params change. URL updates correctly in both cases.

### Chunk 26: concurrent-navigations — SKIPPED (N/A)

**Next.js source**: `concurrent-navigations`
**Not ported**: Only 1 test, production-only, requires middleware rewrite mismatch
recovery (prefetch returns route A but navigation rewrites to route B). Too
Next.js-specific and requires `createRouterAct` test infrastructure.

### Phase 3 Summary

| Chunk                  | Tests  | Pass   | Skip  | N/A               |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----------------- |
| 19. actions-navigation | 1      | 1      | 0     | 0                 |
| 20. actions-revalidate | 6      | 6      | 0     | 0                 |
| 21. app-prefetch       | 7      | 7      | 0     | 0                 |
| 22. metadata-suspense  | 3      | 2      | 1     | 0                 |
| 23. revalidate-dynamic | —      | —      | —     | — (covered by 20) |
| 24. external-redirect  | 1      | 0      | 1     | 0                 |
| 25. search-params-key  | 2      | 2      | 0     | 0                 |
| 26. concurrent-nav     | —      | —      | —     | N/A               |
| **Total**              | **20** | **18** | **2** | **0**             |

### New Issues Found

9. **Duplicate `<title>` tags with Suspense layout** — When a layout wraps children in `<Suspense>`, metadata `<title>` tag appears twice. Fix: `packages/vinext/src/entries/app-rsc-entry.ts` — hoist metadata rendering above Suspense boundaries.
10. **External redirect in server actions** — `redirect('https://example.com')` inside a server action does client-side RSC navigation instead of full page navigation. Fix: `packages/vinext/src/entries/app-rsc-entry.ts` browser entry — detect external origin and use `window.location.href`.

## Phase 4: OpenNext Cloudflare Compatibility Tests

Ported from: https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-cloudflare/tree/main/examples/e2e

### Background

[OpenNext](https://github.com/opennextjs) deploys Next.js apps to non-Vercel platforms (Cloudflare
Workers, AWS Lambda, etc.). Their E2E test suites are **behavioral conformance tests** — they verify
that Next.js features work correctly across different deployment targets. These assertions (what the
user sees, what headers are returned, how caching behaves) are framework-agnostic and portable,
making them a good reference for vinext's own compatibility testing.

**Approach**: We port the _test patterns and assertions_ into our existing Playwright specs, running
against our Vite-based fixture apps. Each test links back to the OpenNext source for reference.

| 8   | ISR data cache: fetch cache separate from page cache              | PASS          | `unstable_cache` returns consistent data across requests |

### ON-2: revalidateTag / revalidatePath E2E Lifecycle

**Source**: https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-cloudflare/blob/main/examples/e2e/app-router/e2e/revalidateTag.test.ts
**Local**: `tests/e2e/app-router/isr.spec.ts` (new tests)
**Fixtures**: `app/revalidate-tag-test/`, `app/revalidate-tag-test/nested/`, `app/api/revalidate-tag/`, `app/api/revalidate-path/`

| #   | OpenNext Test                                                  | Vinext Status | Notes                                                                                      |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Load tagged ISR page → HIT → call `/api/revalidate-tag` → MISS | PASS          | ISR cache entries now tagged with fetch tags; revalidateTag invalidates them               |
| 2   | Nested page shares tag, also invalidated                       | FIXME         | Blocked: revalidateTag does not invalidate ISR cache in dev server                         |
| 3   | After invalidation + regen, subsequent request is HIT          | PASS          | Full lifecycle test in isr.spec.ts (passes because no invalidation occurs, HIT is default) |
| 4   | `revalidatePath` invalidates specific path                     | PASS          | ISR cache entries now tagged with path tags; revalidatePath invalidates them               |

### ON-3: Route Handler HTTP Methods (Exhaustive)

**Source**: https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-cloudflare/blob/main/examples/e2e/app-router/e2e/methods.test.ts
**Local**: `tests/e2e/app-router/api-routes.spec.ts` (enhanced)

| ~~Double-slash open redirect protection~~      | ~~ON-13 #3~~ | **FIXED** — `//` guard added to all entry points (PR #151)                        |

| Middleware request header forwarding           | ON-14 #6     | `x-middleware-request-*` headers not unpacked into `headers()` context            |

### Bug Fixed

**Config headers crash on redirect responses**: `Response.redirect()` creates immutable headers.
When `next.config.ts` defines custom headers via `headers()`, the dev server tried to set them
on all responses, including redirects from trailing slash normalization. This threw at runtime.
Fix: skip applying config headers to 3xx redirect responses in `entries/app-rsc-entry.ts`.

### New Files Created (ON-11 through ON-15)

**Fixture files:**

- `tests/fixtures/app-basic/next.config.ts` — Unified config for redirects, rewrites, custom headers
- `tests/fixtures/app-basic/app/api/catch-all/[...slugs]/route.ts` — Catch-all slug echo
- `tests/fixtures/app-basic/app/api/host/route.ts` — Returns request URL
- `tests/fixtures/app-basic/app/search-query/page.tsx` — Displays searchParams from props + middleware

**Test files (new):**

- `tests/e2e/app-router/middleware.spec.ts` — Middleware redirect, rewrite, block (6 tests)
- `tests/e2e/app-router/config-redirect.spec.ts` — Config redirects, rewrites, headers (8 tests)
- `tests/e2e/app-router/routing-misc.spec.ts` — Trailing slash, catch-all, host, search params (10 tests)

**Modified files:**

- `tests/fixtures/app-basic/middleware.ts` — Added redirect-with-cookie, rewrite, block, search-params paths
- `packages/vinext/src/entries/app-rsc-entry.ts` — Bug fix: skip config headers on redirect responses
- `tests/app-router.test.ts` — Removed dynamic next.config.mjs writing (uses permanent next.config.ts)

## Phase 5: Shim and Core Module Unit Tests

Unit tests for previously untested Next.js shims and core modules. These tests import
directly from source (`packages/vinext/src/shims/`, `packages/vinext/src/server/`,
`packages/vinext/src/routing/`) and test pure functions and SSR rendering via
`ReactDOMServer.renderToString` — no running dev server needed.

**Overlap policy**: 15 redundant tests were removed from `route-sorting.test.ts` that
duplicated exact test cases from the pre-existing `tests/routing.test.ts`. All remaining
tests are either entirely new coverage or complementary to existing integration/E2E tests
(unit-level vs server-level vs browser-level).

### Redundancy Cleanup

15 tests removed from `route-sorting.test.ts` that were exact duplicates of tests in
`routing.test.ts`. Both files imported the same functions (`pagesRouter`, `matchRoute`,
`appRouter`, `matchAppRoute`, `invalidateAppRouteCache`) from the same source modules and
tested the same inputs/assertions. The removed tests covered:

- Pages Router: static-before-dynamic sorting, root/static/dynamic matching, query stripping, trailing slash stripping, catch-all matching, null for unmatched
- App Router: static-before-dynamic sorting, root/static/dynamic matching, null for unmatched, API route matching, @slot filtering

The 12 remaining tests in `route-sorting.test.ts` cover unique functionality: dynamic-before-catch-all ordering, deterministic sorting, static-over-dynamic preference, `patternToNextFormat()` conversion (6 tests), App Router route type discovery, and `apiRouter` sorting (2 tests).
