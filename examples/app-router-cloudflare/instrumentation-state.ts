/**
 * Shared state for instrumentation.ts testing in app-router-cloudflare.
 *
 * ## Why plain module-level variables work here
 *
 * register() is now emitted as a top-level `await` inside the generated RSC
 * entry module (see `generateRscEntry` in `entries/app-rsc-entry.ts`). This means it
 * runs inside the Cloudflare Worker process — the same process and module graph
 * as the API routes. Plain module-level variables are therefore visible to both
 * the instrumentation code and the API route that reads them.
 *
 * This is different from the old approach (writing to a temp file on disk) which
 * was needed when register() ran in the host Node.js process and API routes ran
 * in the miniflare Worker subprocess (two separate processes, no shared memory).
